# Generic OpenSim Model

*We recommend downloading a Markdown reader like [Typora](https://typora.io/) to view the readme files within this dataset.*

The generic OpenSim model used here comes from [Lai et al. (2017)](https://simtk.org/projects/model-high-flex) and is used to map the attachment of muscles on the tibia to the surfaces used in finite element simulations.
